# Plotly-Express
Working with the basics of plotly express and using to analyse the gdp, population dataset of gapminder.<br>
Plotly is a great library for making interactive plots and animations in python. It makes it so easy to create very complex animations.<br>
The dataset used in this project is stored in the plotly express and therefore we can directly read it using the px.data.gapminder command.
